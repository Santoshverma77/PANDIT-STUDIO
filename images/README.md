# Smoke Background Image

## Instructions for Adding the Smoke Background

1. Download the "Smoke" image from Envato Elements: https://elements.envato.com/smoke-FNA4NWE

2. Save the downloaded image as `smoke-bg.png` in this directory.

3. The image should be a high-resolution PNG or JPG file with a transparent or white background.

4. If the image is too dark or too light, you can adjust the opacity in the CSS file (styles.css) by changing the `opacity` value in the `.smoke-bg::before` and section-specific selectors.

## Alternative Options

If you prefer not to use the Envato Elements image, you can:

1. Use a free smoke texture from websites like:
   - Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/s/photos/smoke-texture)
   - Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/search/smoke%20texture/)
   - Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/images/search/smoke%20texture/)

2. Create a custom smoke effect using CSS gradients and animations.

3. Use a video background with a subtle smoke effect.

## CSS Customization

You can customize the smoke effect by adjusting these properties in the CSS file:

- `opacity`: Controls the transparency of the smoke (default: 0.15)
- `background-size`: Controls how the image covers the section (default: cover)
- `background-position`: Controls the position of the image (default: center)
